#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the designing, maintaining, and creation of software. It's importance in the industry is that it allows for the automation of machines, apps, and anything that requires complex systems. Industries have been able to thrive and grow faster thanks to the software that runs them, and to the software engineers who maintain the software. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming. It is a technique for writing programs that are more reliable and readable. It breaks down programs into smaller, more manageable parts
2. Web engineering. It focuses on web application and allows for global engineering allowing for anyone, anywhere to code your applications.
3. Cloud computing. Allows for the delivery of computing services over the internet which hass reduced a lot of travel, printing, and manufacturing of hard-copied software. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. PLanning: This phase involves difining the project goals, objectives, budget, requirementds and other things. It sets the direction of the project, and makes everyone understand what needs to be done and how to do it. 
2. Requirements: This second phase requires you to look at what you truly need for the project to take off or succeed. If you can get majority of required things gottern and sorted through, it can help with how fast the project will move. Some things will be required later on the project that you don't have, but having the required stuff before the project begins means you have a higher chance of completing the project with minor dealys, than being paralysed over things you hadn't planned for. 
3. Design: This third phase is largely based after planning and requiremts. You want to know who you're selling the program to, what they want or don't want. It includes high-level architecture, detailed specification, and user interface. For this part the engineers should handle the back-end where the customers can't see, and let true desginers handle the customer experience. :D
4. Development: This fourth phase involves transforming the design, into a functional application through coding. The working application should be secure, efficient, snd maintainable. 
5. Testing. This fifth phase is trying out the apllication, fixing and identifying defects in the software, and seeing how the software intergrates in various scenarios. 
6. Deplpoyment After all those previous phases the software is deployed to end-users of beta users. Beta means users who try out the application to check for bugs, viruses, and to give their thoughts on the software. 
7. Maintanance. This final phase involves ongoing support to address issues, apply updates, and add new features. It ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology: 
1. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
2. Detailed documentation is necessary for ensuring all team members are aligned.
3. It's suitable for projects with well defined requirements and fixed timelines.

Agile Methodology
1. Emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation
2.  Focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Suitable for projects with evolving requirements.
4. Encourages cross-functional team collaboration.

Waterfall is best for projects with clear requirements and fixed timelines, Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility and continuous improvement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer. Software developers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, and maintaining software applications. They ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and follows best practices. This includes integrating components and debugging existing software.
Qualit Assyrance Engineers are responsible for testing software applications to identify bugs and ensure they meet quality standards. This includes creating test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects.
Project managers oversee the planning phase, defining project scope, timelines, and resource allocation. They ensure that all stakeholders are aligned with project goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDE) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a centralized platform for coding, debugging, and testing, which boosts developer productivity. Features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging tools reduce errors and speed up development. IDEs facilitate teamwork by offering a unified environment for developers to work together on projects, improving communication and productivity

Collaboration: IDEs facilitate team collaboration by offering a unified environment for developers to work together on projects, improving communication and productivity2.

Code Quality: IDEs help enforce coding standards and best practices, leading to cleaner, more maintainable codebases

Efficiency and Productivity: IDEs provide a centralized platform for coding, debugging, and testing, which boosts developer productivity by up to 30%4. Features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging tools reduce errors and speed up development24.

Collaboration: IDEs facilitate team collaboration by offering a unified environment for developers to work together on projects, improving communication and productivity2.

Code Quality: IDEs help enforce coding standards and best practices, leading to cleaner, more maintainable codebases

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
